This repository contains the codebase for a Newspapers web application developed as part of coursework 13663 for the Web Application Development module. The application consists of two main components:

WAD_CW13663_WebApi: This folder contains the backend codebase for the Newspapers web application. It utilizes the Web API framework with a repository pattern for managing data interactions. The backend is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, processing data, and communicating with the database.

13663_WAD_SPA: This folder contains the frontend codebase for the Newspapers web application. It is built using Angular framework and incorporates the Tailwind CSS package for styling. The frontend implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing newspaper-related entities such as articles, authors, categories, etc.

Development Backend: The backend codebase is structured using the repository pattern to separate concerns and facilitate easier maintenance and testing. It includes routes for handling various API requests related to newspaper entities.

Frontend: The frontend application is built using Angular framework and styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and interactive user interface for managing newspapers. It communicates with the backend API to fetch and update data.
